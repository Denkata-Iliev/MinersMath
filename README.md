## Installation

1. Download and install Fabric from here: https://fabricmc.net/use
2. Download Fabric API mod from here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api and place in your mods folder.
3. Download Calculated from https://github.com/nonstopslip/Calculations/releases
4. Start Minecraft and go to Options > Controls > Key Binds > Calculations to change the hotkey.

This is a client-side mod and so doesn't require Fabric on the server.
